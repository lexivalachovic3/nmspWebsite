        <h2>What is the Nutrient Mass Balance Tool?</h2>
        <p><b>Whole-farm</b> nutrient evaluation tool that aids in the management and monitoring of nutrient status and nutrient use efficiency on dairy farms over time
        </p>
        <ul><li>Helps farms <b>optimally allocate nutrients</b> and <b>increase profitability</b></li>
        <li>Focus on <b>N, P and K</b> for now</li>
        <li>Developed with <b>NYS Dairy</b></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="totalNMB">
        <div class="explainNMB">
            <p>The image above shows the inputs and outputs we collect to measure nutrient use. We sum up the balances for each N, P, and K for imports and exports. 
                Using these values we can then find the <b>balance per acre</b> and the <b>balance per cwt (hundredweight, 100 pounds) of milk.</b></p>
        </div>
        <div class="NMB"><img src="img/NMB.png" alt="NMB Inputs and Outputs"/></div></div>
        <p>Here is the data collection form developed by the NMSP team to record these balances. The farms we work with fill this out once a year and send it to our team.
            From there, we take the data and input it into the online tool we had developed.

        <h2>What can we learn from this tool?</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Potential economic and environmental opportunities</li>
                <li>Increased productivity</li>
                <li>Decreased cost of production</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="graphs">
            <div class="n"><img src="img/nitrogen.png" alt="Nitrogen Balances"/></div>
            <div class="p"><img src="img/phosphorus.png" alt="Phosphorus Balances"/></div></div>
            <p>
                The graphs above show the progress made by one of the farms we collaborate with. The top graph represents Nitrogen balance and the bottom represents Phosphorus balance.
                These graphs begin in 2003 and show the progression of these nutrients until 2020. As you can see, there is a slow but relatively constant downward slope of these lines.
                This means that over the 17 years of working with Cornell's NMSP, this farm has made continuous improvements in their environmental footprint. <b>But not all farms follow the same path, look at this farm below:</b>
            </p>
            <div class="spruce"><img src="img/SpruceHaven.jpeg" alt="Spruce Haven Balances"/></div>
            <p>
                This is a different farm presenting nutrient data from 2006 to 2022. As you can see, there was a large increase in nutrient use around 2015. But since then, they have 
                made tremendous improvements. Each farm is very different due to a variety of factors.

        <h2>What we provide to the farmers:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>An "<b>opportunity table</b>" that shows farm key performance indicators (KPI) and "<b>thresholds</b>"</li>
            <li>Used to identify opportunities for <b>continuous improvement</b></li>
            <li>Benchmarks for farmers to compare their balance to <b>feasible limits and peers</b></li>
            <li>Data to show consumers that they are <b>dedicated to sustainable practices</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Farms and their advisors can use this to guide management changes that could help to lower balances and improve efficiency.

            <li><b>No one size fits all solution!!</b></li>
            <li><b>Feed</b> and <b>fertilizer</b> imports are the biggest drivers of balances</li>
            <li><b>Animal density</b> is a key driver</li>
            <li><b>Manure</b> exports have big potential</li>

        <h2>Progress made in New York!</h2>
        <h4>Many dairy farms participating in these assessments since 2005-2007 to more recently (2017-2019):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Produced over <b>50% more milk per acre</b></li>
            <li>36% improvement in <b>P use efficiency</b></li>
            <li><b>Actively engaged</b> in identifying more opportunities for improvement</li>
            <li>Of the feed fed to the animals on farms, almost <b>70% was homegrown</b> feed --> reduces feed imports --> avoid the carbon footprint of transportation</li>
            <li><b>Improved soil health, crop production and climate resiliency</b> with use of manure, and fertilier use</li>
            <li>Implemented practice that <b>promote biodiversity</b> on the farm-base through crop rotation and field management</li>
            <li>Creating a <b>circular economy!</b></li>
